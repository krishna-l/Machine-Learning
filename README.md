These are some of the commonly used Machine Learning algorithms used in real life. Sample codes for these algorithms are pushed into this repo....

The contents are as follows: 
1) Spam classifier using Naive Bayes Classification. 
2) K-Means clustering of random people based on age and income. 
3) Decision Trees.
4) Support Vector Machines
5) Item Based Collaborative Recommender System using Movie lens dataset
6) PCA using Iris dataset.
